title = "About Me"
+++

My name is AJ Frantz.  I enjoy writing [software](https://github.com/ajfrantz)
which interacts with the physical world: sensors, actuator, autonomous
vehicles, robots, etc.

I'm currently taking some time off of work to decompress, but if you find [my
resume](/resume/) interesting, you should probably contact
me at [aj@ajfrantz.com](mailto:aj@ajfrantz.com).

Most of my adult career has been spent working on proprietary products, but I
do hack on [side projects](/projects/) on occaison.

On the internet I generally go by the monikers of either `ajfrantz` or
`eckzow`.
